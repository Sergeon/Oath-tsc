# Oath: a typescript Promise alternative implementation

This repository contains Oath, a typescript module that act like an A+ Promise.
I made this just for fun, to learn some stuff. This is not intended to be used in production. Is not even an npm module.

## How to run the examples:

You need to run `npm install`|`yarn` and have the Parcel bundler installed in your machine.
Parcel bundler is used to transpile the ts code into `dist/`. To do so, just run:
`npm run build`|Â `yarn build`.

Or, if you want to use `oath.ts` in any already set up typescript code, just grab it from `src/`.
