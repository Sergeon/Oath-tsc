# Oath: a typescript Promise alternative implementation

This repository contains Oath, a typescript module that -will, when finished :-D- act like an A+ Promise.
I'm doing this for fun, just to learn some stuff, specially regarding typescript generics.
This is not intended to be used in production. Is not even an npm module.

## How to run the examples:

You need to run `npm install` and have the Parcel bundler installed in your machine.

Parcel bundler is used to transpile the ts code into `dist/`. To do so, just run:
`npm run build`

Or, if you want to use `oath.ts` in any already set up typescript code, just grab it from `src/`.

## Tests

`npm test`
